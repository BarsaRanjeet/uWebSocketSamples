# uWebSocketSamples

## This project explains use of uWebSocket 

> Note: You can read this blog https://medium.com/@rockstudillo/beware-of-uwebsockets-js-b51c92cac83f  before moving further 

even if you read that blog and want to continue then it's up to you so lets get started.\
First of all we need to know that this library uws is no longer available in official node repo so need to install package from github repository\
and you can install it by\
`
npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v19.2.0
`
and your repository is ready to be used in your project so let's move forward

there are two ways you can use it
1. with SSL
2. Non-SSL (that's App()) 

I have created examples for every scenario that i can create for this project
